Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard and most widely used programming language for 
relational databases. It is used to manage and organize data in all sorts of systems in which 
various data relationships exist.

Relational Databases (SQL)
--------------------------
> Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
 . Help users create and maintain a relational database
   - mySQL, Oracle, postgreSQL, mariaDB, etc.
>Structured Query Lnguage (SQL)
 . Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS
 . Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc).
 . Used to define tables am=nd structures
 . SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification.


Non-Relational Databases (noSQL / not just SQL)
------------------------------------------------
> Non-Relational Databse Management System (NRDBMS)
 . Help users create and maintain a non-relational databse
  - mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc
> Implementation Specific
 . Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set languages standard.
 . Most NRDBMS will implement their own languages for performing C.R.U.D and administrative operations on the database.
